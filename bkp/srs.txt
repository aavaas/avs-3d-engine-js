only triangles
dont use edge table
pipelining blocks should be seperate
more focus on structure than optimisation

less focus on:
curve modelling
interface


//previously: calculate all vertex normals and edge table with face adjancy
for each object
	calculate composite matrix
	transform whole mesh with matrix //vertex redundancy removal
	for each triangle:
		back face removal by cyclicity //face redundancy removal
	create edge flow table  //edge redundancy removal
order objects from front to back acc to centre 
for each scan line: for each object	from front to back 
	manage edge flow table //todo merge all objects edge table
	interpolate vertically x,z edges crossing that scanline
	for each edge pairs:  //todo check for front back edges
		interpolate horizontally z
		z buffer compare://lighting redundancy removal
			interpolate normals, colours
			shadow compare
			lighting calculation
			put pixel
